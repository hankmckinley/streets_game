	- Has it always been like this?
		Pop: More or less. Used to be more kids running around. Boy was it hectic back then!
		=> pop_start
		
	- What do you like most about it?
		Pop: The people. I know most of my customers by name. I see kids grow up, parents working hard, neighbors helping neighbors. Some things change and some stay the same.
		=> pop_start

- How long have you had this store?
