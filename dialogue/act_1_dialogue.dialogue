~ pop_start
Pop: Welcome in, kid. What can I do for ya?

- Tell me about this neighborhood.
	Pop: Oh, I'm not sure. Been here longer than some of these buildings that's for sure. Folks look out for each other here. It’s got its ups and downs, but it’s home.

	- Has it always been like this?
		Pop: More or less. Used to be more kids running around. Boy was it hectic back then!
		=> pop_start
		
	- What do you like most about it?
		Pop: The people. I know most of my customers by name. I see kids grow up, parents working hard, neighbors helping neighbors. Some things change and some stay the same.
		=> pop_start

- How long have you had this store?
	Pop: This bodega has been in my family for three generations. My granddad opened it when he moved here, then my pops. Now it's me. A lotta history in these walls.

	- Did you always want to run it?
		Pop: Nah, when I was a kid, I thought I’d do something else. But when my pops got older, I stepped in. Now I can’t imagine doing anything different.
		=> pop_start

	- Do you think your kids will take over?
		Pop: Hard to say. They got their own dreams, and I want them to chase ‘em. But if they ever wanna run the store, I’d be proud to pass it on.
		=> pop_start

- Why is this store so important?
	Pop: You gotta understand, places like this ain't just stores. We keep folks fed when times are tight, we keep an eye on the block. Somebody needs help, they come here. It's more than just a place to by food.

- What kinds of things do you sell?
	Pop: Coffee, eggs, bread. The basics. And of course, my famous sandwiches. You ever had one?

	- No, what’s so special about them?
		Pop: It’s the love, kid. And the secret seasoning. I of course can’t tell you what it is, but once you try one, you’ll keep coming back.
		=> pop_start

	- Yeah, they’re great!
		Pop: Ha! You got good taste. Let me know if you ever want another.
		=> pop_start

- How do you keep the store running?
	Pop: Hard work, kid. And knowing your customers, you gotta give them a reason to come by even if we ain't always the cheapest. 

	- Do you ever think about expanding?
		Pop: Nah, this place is enough. I ain’t looking to be some big chain. This is a neighborhood shop, always will be.
		=> pop_start

	- What’s the hardest part of running it?
		Pop: The hours. Early mornings, late nights. But it’s worth it.
		=> pop_start

- I don’t have any more questions.
	Pop: Alright then. But if you ever need somethin’, you know where to find me.
	=> END
